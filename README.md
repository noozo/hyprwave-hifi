1. **Install and run HyprWave**: `hyprwave`
2. **Start a music player** (Spotify, VLC, etc.)
3. **Control your music** with the on-screen controls
4. **Use keybinds** for quick access (see configuration below)

### Supported Music Players

⚠️ **Limited Support:**

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Config File

Edit `~/.config/hyprwave/config.conf`:

```conf
[General]
# Edge to anchor HyprWave to
# Options: right, left, top, bottom
edge = right

# Margin from the screen edge (in pixels)
margin = 10

[Notifications]
# Enable/disable notifications
enabled = true

# Show notification when song changes
now_playing = true
```

**Layout Options:**
- **`edge = right`** - Vertical layout on right edge (default)
- **`edge = left`** - Vertical layout on left edge
- **`edge = top`** - Horizontal layout on top edge
- **`edge = bottom`** - Horizontal layout on bottom edge

**Notification Options:**

### Keybinds

HyprWave supports keybinds for toggling visibility and expanding details. **Add these to your compositor config:**

#### Hyprland

Add to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```conf
# HyprWave keybinds
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, M, exec, hyprwave-toggle visibility
bind = SUPER, M, exec, hyprwave-toggle expand
```

Then reload: `hyprctl reload`

#### Niri

Add to `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+M { spawn "hyprwave-toggle" "visibility"; }
    Mod+M { spawn "hyprwave-toggle" "expand"; }
}
```

Then reload: `niri msg action reload-config`

#### Sway

Add to `~/.config/sway/config`:

```conf
# HyprWave keybinds
bindsym $mod+Shift+M exec hyprwave-toggle visibility
bindsym $mod+M exec hyprwave-toggle expand
```

Then reload: `swaymsg reload`

#### What the keybinds do:

- **Toggle Visibility** (`Super+Shift+M`) - Smoothly hides/shows entire HyprWave with slide animation
- **Toggle Expand** (`Super+M`) - Shows/hides album details
  - If HyprWave is hidden, this will show it AND expand in one smooth motion

### Auto-start

#### Hyprland
Add to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:
```conf
exec-once = hyprwave
```

#### Niri
Add to `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`:
```kdl
spawn-at-startup "hyprwave"
```


##  Troubleshooting

### Black box around HyprWave (Hyprland)

If you see a black box around HyprWave, disable blur for the overlay:

Add to `hyprland.conf`:
```conf
layerrule = noblur, hyprwave
layerrule = noblur, hyprwave-notification
```
If that doesn't work, it most probably is a broken gtk4 or gtk4-layer-shell package- just remove them, reinstall them, and try it again.

Refer to Issues for a more precise explanation.

### Notifications not appearing

1. Check that notifications are enabled in `~/.config/hyprwave/config.conf`
2. Verify both `enabled = true` and `now_playing = true` under `[Notifications]`
3. Restart HyprWave after config changes

### Keybinds not working

1. Verify `hyprwave-toggle` is installed: `which hyprwave-toggle`
2. Test manually: `hyprwave-toggle visibility` (with HyprWave running)
3. Check your compositor config for syntax errors
4. Reload your compositor config after adding keybinds

### Album art not loading

HyprWave requires the music player to provide album art URLs via MPRIS. Desktop apps work better than web browsers for this.

##  Technical Details

- **Language:** C
- **GUI Framework:** GTK4
- **Layer Shell:** gtk4-layer-shell (Wayland overlay)
- **IPC:** D-Bus (MPRIS2 protocol)
- **Memory:** ~80-95MB
- **CPU:** <0.3% idle, <1% during updates

### File Paths

Resources are searched in this order:
1. Local directory: `./icons/`, `./style.css` (for development)
2. User install: `~/.local/share/hyprwave/`
3. System install: `/usr/share/hyprwave/`

Config: `~/.config/hyprwave/config.conf`
